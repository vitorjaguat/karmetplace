            Launched in December 2023, The Sphere Karmetplace emerges as a
            unique platform, fostering the connection between live art, its
            creators, and the audiences that support them. Developed by Vitor
            Butkus (Uint Studio) and powered by the Reservoir Protocol, this
            marketplace is dedicated to the circulation of live art seeds and
            derivatives within a collaborative spirit of art creation.

              <div className="">
                The Karmetplace ensures that artists continue to receive
                royalties from secondary sales, thanks to its onchain
                enforcement mechanism. This approach guarantees ongoing support
                for creators even after their initial distribution or sale.
                Listings made on other marketplaces also appear here.{' '}

                The Sphere Karmetplace encourages sellers to direct a part of
                their sale proceeds to The Sphere Commons Treasury. This
                collective fund plays a crucial role in sustaining the
                platform's ecosystem. Once the treasury reaches a milestone of
                10,000â‚¬ equivalent in cryptocurrencies and/or stablecoins, it
                triggers a new call for artistic submissions, initiating another
                cycle of creative projects and audience participation.

                At its launch, the Karmetplace features the Karmic Objects and

                diverse range of artistic endeavors within The Sphere's
                ecosystem. These collections represent the initial foray into
                fostering a vibrant network of live art, characterized by
                collaborative interactions among artists, audiences, collectors,
                and curators.
